Rock-paper-scissors
Playing a game of rps against a computer in the console
There is no user interface at this moment, it will play in the console.

We want input from the user in the form of text, and through a prompt
The output first has to show the moves the cpu and the user made and which won. 
Then that output should be repeated five times and display a message saying who won.

A function needs to be created for the cpu to determine its output
of rock paper or scissors. This function needs to randomize between
the three options.

A function needs to be created for the user, that includes the prompt and checks and makes sure the user enters a valid value and then returns that value.

Then the two return values, from the cpu and the player, need to be compared to determine and return the winner.
